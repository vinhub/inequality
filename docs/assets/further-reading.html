<p class=MsoNormal>To understand how this simulation game relates to real-world
processes that generate inequality, consider how modifications of the rules
might alter the outcome:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>What would happen if some players started the game with
     a different number of coins?</b> Imagine a society in which people of
     different social origins have very different levels of wealth. When a
     player with five coins bets two and loses, she has lost 40 percent of her
     assets but is still solvent. By contrast, when someone with two coins bets
     both of them and loses, they have lost 100 percent of their assets and are
     out of the game. In short, an initial advantage goes a long way toward
     success, whereas an initial disadvantage leaves players behind rather
     quickly. In life, the valued good may be education, or income, or wealth
     rather than coins, but initial advantages are still important.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>What would happen if bankrupt players could borrow
     money to get back into the game?</b> Consider the role of financial
     institutions, credit agencies, and other sources of capital. Large
     organizations, for instance, have access to huge amounts of credit and, in
     some cases, are not allowed to fail. In a similar fashion, some people
     have better access to credit than others and are thus better able to
     handle economic misfortune. In essence, the game provides a level playing
     field by denying everyone access to credit; but in the real world, people
     have unequal access to credit and thus different chances of amassing
     wealth or going broke.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>What are the possible consequences of allowing some
     players to pool their resources and play as a group? </b>In the game,
     everyone plays as an individual, but in real life, we are connected to
     groups of relatives, friends, and acquaintances who have economic and
     non-economic resources that can help or hinder our efforts to succeed.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>What would happen if a wealth or inheritance tax had
     been imposed between rounds?</b> Think about the inter-generational
     transfer of wealth in the United States, or income or property taxes and
     how taxes and the social welfare system might restrict the amount of
     income inequality in a society. The basic point is that societies usually
     limit inequality by imposing restrictions on the accumulation and
     transmission of wealth. The game provides no such safeguards.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>What would happen if you could buffer yourself against
     losses?</b> This brings up the options of withdrawing from the game or
     protecting against competition through local isolation or creation of IP,
     or other competitive barriers.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately, you should come to realize that the final
distribution of coins and your personal chances of becoming a winner are not
flukes, but rather the result of the rules of play that determine who gets the
coins and why. You should also realize that even in the real world, where skill
and effort do matter, your ability to get ahead and chances of falling behind
are also determined by taken-for-granted rules and structures of opportunities.</p>
